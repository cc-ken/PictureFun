        <desc>The project is Open Source, It has integrated some funny AI picture processor. It uses NCNN+Vulkan to inference the AI model and then let more users can easily to enjoy the fun brought by the AI. We will continue to research and add more other AI ability to the software in future.</desc>
        <vendor>The project is licensed under GPLv3, it has adopted QT6.2.4 to build the UI and uses OpenCV4.5 to do basic image processing, uses NCNN+Vulkan as the AI inference engine. Currently pretrained AI models have:
            - Modnet to background remover
            - RealESRGan for super resolution
